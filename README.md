**Gmail Inbox Labels** is a Chrome extension that modifies the behavior of Gmail labels in the sidebar so that clicking a label only shows emails that are in the inbox.

The motivation behind this extension is to recreate the functionality from Google's now-deprecated Inbox app, which made it easier to sort through emails by allowing users to go through each bundle of emails in their inbox separately. With this extension, you can filter emails by label while ensuring that only inbox emails are displayed, helping you prioritize and organize more efficiently.

## Installation

Since the extension is not yet verified on the Chrome Web Store, you can manually install it as a `.crx` file. Alternatively, you can download this repo and load the extension as an "unpacked extension" directly.

### 1. Download the `.crx` File

Download the extension's `.crx` file from [here](https://github.com/martimlobao/gmail-inbox-labels/releases).

### 2. Enable Developer Mode in Chrome

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer Mode** by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.

### 3. Install the Extension

1. Drag and drop the `.crx` file you downloaded into the `chrome://extensions/` page.
2. You may see a confirmation dialog. Click **Add Extension** to complete the installation.

The extension should now be installed and ready to use.
